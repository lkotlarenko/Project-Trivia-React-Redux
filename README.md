## What was developed

We developed a game of questions and answers based on the game **Trivia** using _react and Redux_, in a group we created the app functionality according to the demands defined in a _kanban_ board.

### Some functionalities developed
- Log in to the game and, if the email used is registered on the website [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) use the avatar photo from there.
- Access the game page, where you should choose one of the answers for each of the questions presented. The answer should be marked before the time counter reaches zero, otherwise, the answer should be considered wrong.
- Be redirected to the score screen after 5 questions are answered, where the text shown depends on the number scored.
- View the ranking page at the end of each game.
- Configure some options for the game on an accessible configuration screen from the app header.
